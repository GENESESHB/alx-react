### Project: 0x05. React state


#### Overview
This project aims to enhance a React application by implementing state management techniques such as local state, controlled components, React context, and React Hooks. Through a series of tasks, various features and functionalities will be added to improve user experience and maintain application state efficiently.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

- **Understand Component State**: Grasp the concept of component state in React and its significance in building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
  
- **Implement Local State Management**: Learn to manage local state within React components to handle component-specific data and UI interactions effectively.
  
- **Utilize Controlled Components**: Master the usage of controlled components to manage form inputs and ensure synchronization between React state and UI elements.
  
- **Implement React Context**: Explore the React context API to manage global application state and share data across components without the need for prop drilling.
  
- **Utilize React Hooks**: Gain proficiency in using React Hooks to simplify and optimize stateful logic within functional components, thereby improving code readability and maintainability.

#### Tasks
1. **Adding a Local State for Notifications**
   - **Introduction**: Introduce local state to manage the display of notifications panel within the application.
   - **Implementation Steps**: Implement functions to control the display of the panel based on user interactions.
   - **Testing**: Modify components and tests accordingly to handle state changes and ensure proper functionality.

2. **Controlled Components and State Callback**
   - **Introduction**: Create a login form within the Login component.
   - **Implementation Steps**: Implement controlled components to manage form inputs and synchronize them with React state.
   - **State Callbacks**: Manage state callbacks to enable/disable form submission based on input validity.

3. **Context**
   - **Introduction**: Implement a simple React context for user authentication and application-wide state management.
   - **Refactoring**: Refactor components to use context for accessing user authentication status and related functions.
   - **Functionality**: Implement login/logout functionality and thoroughly test to ensure proper behavior.

4. **Context Consumer & Advanced State**
   - **Introduction**: Subscribe components to context changes for dynamic updates based on user authentication status.
   - **Advanced State Manipulation**: Implement advanced state manipulation techniques, such as marking notifications as read, using React state.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance using PureComponent and efficient state updates for enhanced user experience.

5. **Introduction to React Hook**
   - **Introduction**: Enhance a component using React Hooks to manage state without writing a class component.
   - **Functionality**: Implement checkbox functionality with hooks and apply appropriate styling to enhance user interaction.

#### Resources :file
- **State and Lifecycle**: Understand the lifecycle of React components and how state plays a role in it.
- **setState and State Callback**: Learn about React's setState function and how to utilize it effectively.
- **Context**: Explore React's Context API for managing global state in your application.
- **Forms and Controlled Components**: Understand controlled components and their importance in form handling.
- **Lifting State Up**: Learn about lifting state up in React to share state between components.
- **React Hooks**: Dive into React Hooks, a new feature in React for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **Enzyme**: Utilize Enzyme for testing React components and state changes.

#### Requirements :done
- **Development Environment**: Utilize Node.js 12.x.x and npm 6.x.x for development.
- **Editors**: Use allowed editors such as vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code.
- **File Formatting**: Ensure all files end with a new line for consistency.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a README.md file at the root of the project directory for documentation and instructions.
- **Quality Assurance**: Perform manual QA review after completing each task to verify functionality and adherence to requirements.
- **Auto Review**: Run auto review at the project deadline to ensure completeness and correctness of the codebase.
